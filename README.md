![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
## Description
This weather application fetches an API response from the OpenWeather One Call API 3.0 which delivers a current forecast and a five-day outlook for a city that a user 
inputs. User are also able to re-search past queries by clicking buttons on the application that are generated via `localStorage`. The application in its current state is quite simple, but later, SCSS and Express will be added so that users can sign in and enjoy an app that doesn't look as generic and Bulma-y as this one.
